# resonator_lib

A rough-around-the-edges script for generating interdigital transducers and assorted other structures (bar/disc resonators, TLM, alignment grid for 2D material transfer, etc). 

All device types/combinations not thoroughly tested, so use at your own risk and double check generated cells. 
Contributions and bug reports welcome.
